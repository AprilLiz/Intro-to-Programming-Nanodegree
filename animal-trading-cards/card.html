			<p>The Siberian tiger is reddish-rusty, or rusty-yellow in color, with narrow black
				transverse stripes. To keep themselves from becoming cold in the winters,
        Siberian tigers have thicker fur coats than tigers which live in southern Asia.
        They are also called "Amur tiger", "Manchurian tiger", "Korean tiger", and "Ussurian tiger",
				depending on the region where individuals were observed.</p>
